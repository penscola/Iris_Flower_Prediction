# Iris_Flower_Prediction
It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

## Dataset
The dataset contains a set of 150 records under five attributes - petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and species.

## Objective
The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor or virginica) from measurements of sepals and petals' length and width.

## Algorithms Used
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. K-Nearest Neighbors
5. Support Vector Machine
6. Naive Bayes
7. XGBoost

## Evaluation Metrics
1. Confusion Matrix
2. Accuracy Score
3. Classification Report

## Conclusion
The accuracy score achieved using Logistic Regression is 0.9666666666666667
